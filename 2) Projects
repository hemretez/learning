P1: a) Using GIT : learning git using collidoscope
Project a1)
So, I thought about some projects that I thought would be useful to learn the things in 1)

- To begin with, I want to make write my own version of Collidoscope and do a study. This will be working on C++ and GIT. I am just assuming that Fiore is very good at C++, just because he wrote that code, but I am not sure if that is a good example of a contempprary, high level C++ code. Nevertheless, a professor of software engineering once told me that the best to learn a programming language is to find a good code and change it for your needs, so I am planning to do that. What do you think?

And while doing this, I will use GIT as you suggested. Do you use git desktop, or do you do everything from terminal?







P2: b) c++ : Collidoscope development for my PhD

Under construction…
First task is to learn all the symbols and what they do in C++, such as >>





P3: b,d,f,h) c++,PD,Bela,Synth :  Intellijel Metropolis On PD & Bela



P4: b,d) c++, Dsp : Make one VST you’d use, with juce




P5: b,d,h) c++,Dsp : Physical Modelling Synth and Waveguides
Learn what they are
Theory, applications
Try to implement them on Bela to make a NIME

Possible projects:
Trombone
Percussion instrument
Veg/ fruit cutting
P6: d) Dsp : Karplus Strong

Learn what they are
Theory, applications
Try to implement them on Bela to make a NIME

Possible projects:
Veg/ fruit cutting
Trombone
Percussion instrument
P7: c) Python


P8: m) Sound Design
Tau cannon:
Bela , Pd, motors, lights, FSR
Synthesize the Tau Cannon sound if you can, if not just use the wavs
Physically build it


P9: i) machine learning/generative music/music analysis
Youtube videos dload – 1000
Auto music analysis
Audio mashup + https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvT_6RIaPJ8 on the top
Video cut & play accordingly

In process…

P10: f) PD/Max
Think of a project when you find the right time & place & motivation.
