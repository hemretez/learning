2) Projects I want to make

Project a1)
So, I thought about some projects that I thought would be useful to learn the things in 1)

- To begin with, I want to make write my own version of Collidoscope and do a study. This will be working on C++ and GIT. I am just assuming that Fiore is very good at C++, just because he wrote that code, but I am not sure if that is a good example of a contempprary, high level C++ code. Nevertheless, a professor of software engineering once told me that the best to learn a programming language is to find a good code and change it for your needs, so I am planning to do that. What do you think?

And while doing this, I will use GIT as you suggested. Do you use git desktop, or do you do everything from terminal?
