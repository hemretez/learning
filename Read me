Read me:

This folder includes:
1) the things I want to learn and be experienced in(skills and all) - enough that I can confidently add to my CV and even apply to junior jobs/internships
2) projects I want to make - these are thought around what I want to/feel the need to learn.     
3) questions I have - these will be constantly updated and I will also add the answers I find combined with yours.
4) logs are what I'm currently doing. I aim to spend 1 hour on whatever on the menu, everyday
5) meeting notes - taken and written by me: notes from our meetings
let's begin!

PS1: These are open to discussion, so I'd like to discuss and possibly change the projects and/or the elements and/or the order of the taking on the lists.
